Big O is a measure of algorithm speed - not in seconds, but in growth of number of operations as input changes. As the input increases the differences grow.

Constant - O(1) Example: Array insertion
Logarithmic - O(log n) example: Binary/Dictionary Search (halving the input each time)
Linear - O(n) Example: Simple Search (Searching one by one)
Log Linear - O(n\* log n) Example: Quicksort
Quadratic - O(n^2) Example: Selection Sort
Exponential - O(c^n) Example: Knapsack
Factorial - O(n!) Example: Traveling Salesman
