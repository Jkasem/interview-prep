Big O is a measure of algorithm speed - not in seconds, but in growth of number of operations as input changes. As the input increases the differences grow.

Constant - O(1) Example:
Logarithmic - O(log n) example: Binary Search
Linear - O(n) Example: Simple Search
n log-star n - O(n\* log n) Example: Quicksort
Quadratic - O(n^2) Example: Selection Sort
Factorial - O(n!) Example: Traveling Salesman
