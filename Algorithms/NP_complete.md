Finding the perfect solution is a factorial equation. It gets very hard to solve very quickly as N increases. Believed it is not possible to find a fast optimal solution for these.

Examples include: Traveling Salesman problem and Set Covering problem

Solve using an approximation algorithm (AKA greedy)
