Solve problems "pretty well", might not be perfect but they get close.

At each step, pick the optimal move.

Example:

You are a thief and want to steal the most expensive item. You can run away with 50 pounds in your hands.

There are 3 items:

1. A painting worth \$3000 that weighs 20 pounds
2. A sculpture worth \$5000 weighs 40 pounds
3. A vase worth \$2500 that weighs 28 pounds

The greedy algorithm would do the most optimal move first by taking the most expensive item, the sculpture. It is not the most optimal as taking the painting and vase would yield a higher value, but it is close.
