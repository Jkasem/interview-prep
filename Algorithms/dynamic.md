Dynamic Programming - Breaking a problem into smaller parts

Only works when each subproblem is discrete. Can't be divided to use other subproblems.

Useful when trying to optimize something given a constraint ie. Knapsack where you can only hold a certain amount of weight.

Use a grid to solve these problems.

Examples:

- Levenshtein distance measures how similar two strings are.
- Git diff
- Similarities in DNA strands
