### 1.1

An algorithm is a procedure that takes any of the possible input instances
and transforms it to the desired output.

`insertion sort` is a method for sorting that starts with a single element (thus forming a trivially sorted list) and then incrementally inserts the remaining elements so that the list stays sorted.

```
insertion_sort(item s[], int n)
{
    int i,j; /* counters */
            for (i=1; i<n; i++) {
            j=i;
            while ((j>0) && (s[j] < s[j-1])) {
                swap(&s[j],&s[j-1]);
            j = j-1;
        }
    }
}
```

Take-Home Lesson: There is a fundamental difference between algorithms,
which always produce a correct result, and heuristics, which may usually do a
good job but without providing any guarantee.

```
Problem: Robot Tour Optimization
Input: A set S of n points in the plane.
Output: What is the shortest cycle tour that visits each point in the set S?
```

This is an example of the traveling salesman problem.

Could try enumerating every possible path:

```
OptimalTSP(P)
d = ∞
For each of the n! permutations Pi of point set P
If (cost(Pi) ≤ d) then d = cost(Pi) and Pmin = Pi
Return Pmin
```

.. but this would take the fastest computer days to compute. Similarly,

### 1.2

```
Problem: Movie Scheduling Problem
Input: A set I of n intervals on the line.
Output: What is the largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals which can
be selected from I?
```

A scheduling problem is O(2^n) which also is extremely slow with a large amount of inputs. This time there is an optimal solution though.

```
OptimalScheduling(I)
While (I = ∅) do
Accept the job j from I with the earliest completion date.
Delete j, and any interval which intersects j from I.
```

Take-Home Lesson: Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm
correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.

### 1.3

We need tools to distinguish correct algorithms from incorrect ones, the primary one of which is called a proof.

A proper mathematical proof consists of several parts. First, there is a clear,
precise statement of what you are trying to prove. Second, there is a set of assumptions
of things which are taken to be true and hence used as part of the proof.
Third, there is a chain of reasoning which takes you from these assumptions to the
statement you are trying to prove. Finally, there is a little square ( ) or QED at the
bottom to denote that you have finished, representing the Latin phrase for “thus
it is demonstrated.”

Types of notation: english, pseudocode, programming language. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.

Problem specifications have two parts: (1) the set of allowed input instances,
and (2) the required properties of the algorithm’s output. It is impossible to prove
the correctness of an algorithm for a fuzzily-stated problem. Put another way, ask
the wrong problem and you will get the wrong answer.

The best way to prove that an algorithm is incorrect is to produce an instance in
which it yields an incorrect answer. Such instances are called counter-examples.
