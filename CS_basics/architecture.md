CPU - central processing unit
CPU word - size of data that the CPU can work with
RAM - Random Access Memory - large array of bytes
CPU instruction - byte sequence in RAM that tells the CPU to carry out a certain action
CPU register - small number of special storage, think variables. Quick to access
CPU clock - number of times per second that the CPU does something
System bus - collection of wires from the motherboard to connect to other hardware

- Memory bus: CPU to RAM
- I/O bus: CPU to peripherals
- Control bus: read/write

Concurrency: Executing at virtually the same time. "Dealing with a lot at once"
Parallelism: Physically executing multiple tasks at the same time through multiple CPU cores. "Doing a lot at once"
