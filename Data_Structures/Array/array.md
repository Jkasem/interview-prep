https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure

Arrays are like a chest of drawers or seats in a movie theatre. Each spot has a certain order to it. This spot is called and index and the first one starts at 0. If you wanted to add a brand new spot to a chest of drawers it would be very difficult. Reading in a random order is very easy, but adding and deleting takes longer.
